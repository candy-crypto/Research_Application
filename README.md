How to set up the prototype:

- The Teachable Machine link to my model is needed to see the running program in Scratch:
  https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/bt6xwyfs2/
- Good news! The link should already be in the code
- Go to Scratch with this link:
  https://playground.raise.mit.edu/create/
- Download the sb3 file onto your computer
- In Scratch, select File and "Load from your computer"
- The yellow blocks on top give instruction on what to click to get run the program
